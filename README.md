Users can start chatting by authenticating through his phone number & this is only for once until he uninstalls and reinstalls the application again. The persons he is allowed to chat are taken from his contact list of that iPhone or iPad. Those people are using knoX and as well as they are present in his phone contact list only with them he is allowed to chat. All kinds of data will be stored on the cloud database. It is not a matter if he uninstalls the application because when he will get back and install the application again he will be able to start from where he left.
